1. Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file. (use enjoysport.csv)
2. Implement email spam classification using naive Bayes algorithm.
3. Implement Linear regression to predict house prices using:
	* (3_1_1)Least squared method(use both homeprices_uni.csv & multivariate.csv)
	* (3_1_2)Normal equations. (use  homeprices_uni.csv)
